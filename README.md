- Created efficient SQL queries utilizing joins, foreign keys, and pagination for optimal performance.
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints with .NET using C# , and thoroughly tested them with Postman for reliability.
- Designed and implemented intuitive and aesthetically pleasing components in React for a better user experience.
- Utilized CSS and Bootstrap to ensure consistent and responsive styling across the Newsletters feature.
- Followed best practices and utilized proper naming conventions and casing to avoid conflicts with team members' code.
- Maintained an organized workflow using Git and GitHub for version control.
- Created and managed new branches to ensure organization and avoid conflicts.
- Performed commits and pull requests regularly to maintain consistency and quality in the codebase.
